# FlightPricePrediction
I did two main things in this project:
1. Analyze data on domestic flights in India in 2019 to determine what features most impact the price of a flight. 
2. Experiment with various types of machine learning models, their hyperparameters, as well as feature selection to find a model that can accurately predict the price of a flight.

The code is in the .py file, but for a quick overview of the work I've done, analysis on each of the features, and results of the various models I've trained, see the pdf.
